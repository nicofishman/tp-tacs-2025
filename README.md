# tp-tacs

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, React Router, Elysia, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **React Router** - Declarative routing for React
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Elysia** - Type-safe, high-performance framework
- **Bun** - Runtime environment
- **Prisma** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **MongoDB** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```
## Database Setup

This project uses MongoDB with Prisma ORM.

1. Make sure you have MongoDB set up.
2. Update your `apps/server/.env` file with your MongoDB connection URI.

3. Generate the Prisma client and push the schema:
```bash
bun db:push
```


Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
